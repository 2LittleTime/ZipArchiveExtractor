Zip File Archive Extractor
**************

Blake Mccabe - 20131003

The purpose of this small app is to extract files of a defined file name pattern from a zip archive folder to another folder.

It was built for the UsWeather Summary app (http://usweathersummary.azurewebsites.net) as the process of moving approximately 72 files from the QCLCD arvhives folders by hand was very tedious and error prone.

By resetting the values in the origin path, file matching, and destination strings, anyone can use the app to extract the desired files from zip archive folders programmatically.
